## Background & Objectives

Creation of a JavaScript game: an animal Raceüê∞üê¢. It's a simple game where you use your keyboard to make an animal move forward. Each player will move their animal by tapping a key (e.g. `r` or `R` for Rabbit, `t` or `T` for Turtle)

The goal here is to use JavaScript, the DOM, and asynchronous event handling.

Launch your local webserver with:

rake webpack
```
Then open [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) in your favorite web browser

## Features
* Race track is a two-player board built with HTML table;
* The player's positions are updated by moving the `active` class from one `td` to the next one;
* JavaScript functions will update a player's position and make the animal move along the race track (td's) with the use of nextElementSibling JS property.
* The `keyup` event type will trigger the animal to move forward;
* A JS alert is used to announce the winner, once the first animal reaches the finish line;
* To restart the game we use `window.location.reload();`;

## Technologies
Project created with:
* HTML5
